	\textbf{Masters Thesis: Selective optimizations and Evaluation of a Directory-less Protocol on Distributed Shared Memory Multiprocessors.}

	Distributed Shared Memory multiprocessors have been using directory based approaches to maintain the state of the cache lines at home node. This approach has a major memory access overhead, for reading the directory, in cases when the line is in the modified state. I worked on designing a protocol that circumvents this problem by broadcasting the incoming request to all nodes in the system. Broadcasting all incoming requests puts a large amount of load on the coherence controller, so techniques to reduce the average load on it were also evaluated.

	\textbf{Prediction of header and addresses in a packet in a Distributed Shared Memory System}

	The project dealt with the use of prediction algorithms for predicting the header and contents of request messages in a DSM system. This helps in reducing the effect of memory access latency and improves system performance considerably. To keep the hardware costs minimal, simple algorithms were used which needed to be finely configured.\hfill \emph{[September - November 2004]}
